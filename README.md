# Friday the 13th the Game Skillcheck Bot (Alpha)

You don't need to complete skillchecks anymore, let the bot do it while you enjoy the game!  
[Инструкция на русском языке](./READMErus.md)

## Requirements
1. Windows 10;
2. Python 3.5 if you want to run it from the sources.

## Installation and usage
You have 2 options to use this bot: launch an application that I've built for you or run the source code using Python's interpreter. It's up to you how to use it.  

* Download the files from this repository
* If you want just run-and-use the bot, go to the dist/main folder and launch main.exe.
* Just enter the game and start repairing anything. You'll see the magic!
* If you want to stop the bot, just press and hold `Q` for 3 seconds.

If for any reasons you want to run the bot from the sources, make sure that you have Python 3.5 and pip installed. At first install all the packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` Most probably some packages won't be installed via pip so you have to download them manually. If everything is fine, just run `python main.py` and enjoy!
 
 ## Known issues
 As this bot is in alpha yet, some errors may be occurred. The most annoying one is that once you open another application that has non-latin letters in it's title, the bot will fall. I know about it and it'll be fixed soon. Until that just turn the bot off if you don't play the game.  
 If you face any other problems please open the issue and I'll try to help you with it.
